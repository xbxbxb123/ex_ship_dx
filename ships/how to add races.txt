To make modded races use this ship, copy any of the race folders here. 
Then rename the folder and each of the files that have the species name in it to whatever the modded race's name is. 
Finally, replace the name of the treasure pool in the blockKey.config file to whatever the starter treasure for that race is named. 
If the modded race uses the same format that vanilla does, then this should work.
There is definitely some way to automate this process, or some very complex way to make it automatically work for all races, but I have no idea how.
Oh yeah, if you don't know already, you should do this by making a new mod with the same file structure as this one and putting the modified copies there.
